			<p>They were furious. They felt like he'd thought of them as foolish monkeys, and he'd fallen into their trap. <br>
			 <br>
			 How dare he mess with us in our territory? <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate stepped back, and adjusted his labcoat. "Don't move, you'll be turned into a pool of blood. But surrender, and we'll let you leave alive." <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao looked at the guns. The officials were watching through the cameras. The vents could release gas. <br>
			 <br>
			 He issued a command. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Launch virus." <br>
			 <br>
			 The mech connected to a standby computer, and activated a virus within the intranet. <br>
			 <br>
			 Their system fell without much effort, and he gained control in 3 seconds. <br>
			 <br>
			 This wasn't some last-minute virus; he installed an anti-takeover program, to stop any outsiders from taking it over, along with the usual invading programs. <br>
			 <br>
			 A map of the institute displayed on his HUD. He issued another command. The exhibition room's doors opened, the showcases slid out, and the guns on the ceilings retracted. <br>
			 <br>
			He already knew this place's security system. There are tightly-guarded warehouses with huge drug inventories, but it was too much to take. The exhibition room was just right. <br>
			 <br>
			 The officials were horrified. <br>
			 <br>
			 "What happened? We've lost control of the system!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Quick, take back control!" <br>
			 <br>
			The technician at the side was sweating. He tried to stop it, but commands wouldn't stop running in the terminal. Suddenly, his screen turned green, then black. It shut off. The
			technician exclaimed, "The speed of this program is too fast; it's impossible to stop it!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "He planned this yesterday!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate was stunned. He stared at Han Xiao, and fell to the ground. "I-I..." <br>
			 <br>
			 Bang! <br>
			 <br>
			 Smoke rose from a dent in the ground. It hit right between his legs. <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate didn't dare to move. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Don't move, and I'll let you live," Han Xiao mocked. <br>
			 <br>
			 "O-Okay, calm down," Kate replied. His back drenched in cold sweat, he could only tremble. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao broke the showcases, and put the vials inside his backpack. Soon, it was filled. <br>
			 <br>
			 He patted his bag. <br>
			 <br>
			He had no intention of robbing the institute. However, Han Xiao didn't care about stealing from the wicked. Han Xiao, and them weren't good, so following the rules of the wicked
			was correct. The strong takes from the weak. <br>
			 <br>
			If anyone made Han Xiao unhappy, he wouldn't hesitate to take on old habits from his player days, and robbing whoever he felt. Furthermore, he was interested in the drugs. He lik
			ed to convince people of his virtue, but otherwise, he'd fight them. <br>
			 <br>
			He didn't like the idea of sacrificing yourself for others, and certainly wasn't a superhero. But he still liked the kind. A kind person was better than an evil person. Even evil
			 would rather befriend the kind; it was worry-free. No back-stabbings. <br>
			 <br>
			 However, the number was dwindling. A smile could have ulterior motives behind it. Loyal brothers may talk behind their backs. Betrayal was common, even between old friends. <br>
			 <br>
			Kind people were so rare, they'd be in zoos within 50 years. But the news would be a better term. The institute toyed with the duo, and it was because of these hypocrites that ki
			nd people lessened, society became worse off, and spiritual traditions collapsed. <br>
			 <br>
			Very often, perseverance was just the minimum of what one should do. Hard work was just for profit. So just like how they used Yang Dian, and Ned's passion, Han Xiao robbed them
			of their hard work. <br>
			 <br>
			 An old saying appeared in Han Xiao's mind. "Karma will find it's way. Wickedness will be dealt with by the wicked." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Looks like I'm wicked." Han Xiao laughed. An opportunity to do bad things without feeling guilty didn't come often. <br>
			 <br>
			 Why spend money on someone he could rob from? He'd just change his face, and become a new customer anyway. <br>
			 <br>
			 It wasn't time to see the fruits of his labor. He took his backpack, and walked to the elevator. <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate's body was still unable to move. He sighed as Han Xiao left, but the fear still lingered in his mind. <br>
			 <br>
			 The officials' hearts bled when they saw the drugs being stolen. One yelled, "Quickly, what can we do?!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Tell the electricians to cut off all electricity in the basement, and trap him there!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Call for Maple! We still have some guards, so gather them at the gate. We must stall him until the military arrives! Crush him!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao called the elevator as the lights shut off. He raised his eyebrows, and switched to night vision. As expected. <br>
			 <br>
			 The muscle fiber's power gathered in his legs, and burst. The floor cracked, and the building shook as he shot through the ceiling. <br>
			 <br>
			 Two floors up, and he landed in a hall. Tenty guards, gathered together. Han Xiao's way of climbing floors didn't give much time for them to react. <br>
			 <br>
			 They were shocked by the mech's power. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Stall the enemy! The rest of the guards will be here soon- f*ck!" <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao slammed the guards, and sent them flying. The guards couldn't slow him down as he broke out, and disappeared into the streets. The civilians only saw a blur of black go
			past them. <br>
			 <br>
			 The officials were enraged, they were hoping the guards could stall him. <br>
			 <br>
			   The drugs couldn't be retrieved, and their hearts bled. They were furious. <br>
			 <br>
			 "When will the military arrive?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Ten minutes." <br>
			 <br>
			 "That's too long! That asshole will be long gone! Is there any other way?" <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate calmed himself, and said, "The duo is still in the city. I'll contact them now!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Hurry!" <br></p>

			<p>A phone call from Kate popped up on Yan Dian's phone. "Mr. Kate, are you looking for us?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "A thiefr's taken our products, including the cure. We can't just make another one, so we need you guys to get it!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Ned stopped what he was doing. "We'll help." <br>
			 <br>
			 "You're our only hope. The enemy is in a black mech, I'm sending the coordinates now!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Black mech? <br>
			 <br>
			 "Could it be him?" <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			Running around in a mech was too flashy. As soon as Han Xiao left, he went to the rooftops. That way, if someone saw him, it'd be just one person for a second. He searched for a
			hiding place to take off the mech, and change his face. <br>
			 <br>
			 So many drugs, enough to drink like water. Han Xiao laughed. <br>
			 <br>
			 He jumped into an alley. Two vitats popped up on his radar, and the database found a match. <br>
			 <br>
			 They're chasing me? Han Xiao knew they were being toyed with by them again. <br>
			 <br>
			 A notice popped up on the interface. <br>
			 <br>

			 <br>
			 You have triggered mission [Trial of a Hero] <br>

			Mission Introduction: Heroes of justice are never in short supply, but many lose sight of their goals. Some become depraved, some become what they swore to fight, some are used,
			and lied to. Justice is a tough path, and you will be their trial towards true heroicism. <br>
			 <br>
			 Mission Requirements: Defeat Yang Dian, and Ned, and expose Louis Research Institute. <br>
			 <br>
			 Rewards: Random <br>

			 <br>
			 Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. <br>
			 <br>
			 He was interested, as it was a chance to feel what it's like to be the bad guy. <br>
			 <br>
			 I've got a few minutes, just enough time to play. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao waited. Yang Dian, and Ned ran past the alley entrance. It took the duo 3 seconds to realize they passed him, then they ran back. <br>
			 <br>
			 "It is you!" Yang Dian's face was stern. He had seen his power, and knew he'd be beaten in a few punches. But the thought of Han Xiao stealing the cure made him not back up. <br>
			 <br>
			 Ned rubbed his hands. "Even though you saved us before, we can't let you steal the cure." <br>
			 <br>
			 Cure? Damn, these guys really are stupid enough to help the Institute. <br>
			 <br>
			 Ned's palms slapped the air, and the ground cracked. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao leaped toward them. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian gnashed his teeth, and swung a punch. <br>
			 <br>
			 Bang! <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao's fist was like a lightning bolt, it impacted Yang Dian's chest. Yang Dian's vision went wobbly, and the scenery went past. He slammed into a wall, and a crater formed b
			ehind him. <br>
			 <br>
			 A one-hit. <br>
			 <br>
			His power was even stronger than the lion. Yang Dian fell off the wall, and panted, as he stood up, leaning against the wall. A gust of wind shot, and Ned smashed the wall beside
			 him, and fell to his feet with a huge bump on his forehead. All from a simple headbutt. <br>
			 <br>
			 Not even three seconds... Yang Dian was sad, and angry. How are we supposed to fight someone like this? <br>
			 <br>
			 Helplessness filled their hearts. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao looked at the timer. He gave himself five minutes, but it'd only been ten seconds. <br>
			 <br>
			 They were both Superhumans at level 30~, but with his strength, it was a piece of cake. <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao stepped toward them. Yang Dian struggled to his feet with a face of righteous anger. He clenched his teeth, and said, "Many people will die, because of this. I'll stop y
			ou no matter what!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao stopped. He had a mocking smile. "Dying a hero...other than dead flowers, empty words, and a few hypocritical tears, what else do you get?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "What others see doesn't matter. I'm content with dying here!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian blinked. A hand grabbed his head, and he smashed into the wall, shattering bricks. <br>
			 <br>
			 His head bled, and he lay flat on the ground. He didn't even have the strength to stand. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao took out his handgun, and put it against Yang Dian's forehead. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian came to his senses. Han Xiao stepped on his legs, and his finger placed on the trigger. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian's eyes widened. Regret flooded his mind. <br>
			 <br>
			 If I wasn't so meddlesome, I wouldn't've died. In front of such a strong foe, I couldn't stop him. It was impossible. I should've ignored this request. I was impulsive... <br>
			 <br>
			 Ka! <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao pressed the trigger. Yang Dian's entire body shook, but there was no pain. He was shocked, Han Xiao backed a few steps. Cold sweat drenched his clothes, and he knew his
			expression was fearful, and regretful. <br>
			 <br>
			 "What were you thinking I was gonna do?" Han Xiao asked. <br>
			 <br>
			Yang Dian kept silent. Facing death, his resolved shook. He wasn't as generous, or tough as he said. Instead, it was regret he felt, and he wished he didn't accept the request. Y
			et, he always wanted to be a superhero, he wanted to save people; he wanted to protect them, and sacrifice parts of himself for others. <br>
			 <br>
			 Now, he felt lost. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao put his handgun back into the holster, took out his laptop, pressed a few keys, and threw Yang Dian a thumbdrive. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian, and Ned didn't move, or say a thing as he left. <br>
			 <br>
			 Just like that, he left? <br>
			 <br>
			 "Why didn't he finish us off?" Yang Dian held the thumb drive. <br>
			 <br>
			 "We are no match for him. Don't follow him, instead we need to leave." Yang Dian held onto Ned, and he carried him, limping. <br>
			 <br>
			Another mission failure, the duo's were ashamed. They couldn't face Kate. They arrived at the Institute, and the military had already locked down the area. The duo didn't want to
			 meet them, so they went back to where they rested, and bandaged their wounds. <br>
			 <br>
			Yang Dian kept thinking about what he said. He couldn't focus at all. He sat on his bed, and thoughts were filling his mind. His belief he was a superhero was shaken; there was a
			 war in his mind. <br>
			 <br>
			 Ned couldn't hold back his curiosity, and plugged the thumbdrive into the laptop. <br>
			 <br>
			"Yang, come here, and look at this!" <br></p>

			<p class="center">////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><br>
			<p>"What is it?" Yang Dian looked over Ned's shoulder. He was stunned. <br>
			 <br>
			 Every project related to the Death Virus were regarding body enhancements, and biochemical weapons. There was no mention of a cure. <br>
			 <br>
			 It was also written the exploration team were gathering materials for body enhancement research. <br>
			 <br>
			 "I-is this real? He's tricking us, right?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "He could have killed us then. Why would he trick us?" <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian, and Ned were enraged. <br>
			 <br>
			 They were useful idiots from the beginning to the end. They couldn't believe they were so naive to believe their words; like their perserverance was nothing, but a joke. <br>
			 <br>
			 No wonder he didn't kill them; he probably felt they were pitiful. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian was so ashamed he wanted to dig a hole, and hide. <br>
			 <br>
			 They called themselves superheroes, but they were saved by a stranger who thought of as evil twice! If he hadn't exposed the truth, they would have kept following orders. <br>
			 <br>
			 "I wish we knew his name. l'd want to apologize to him in person," Ned said. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian nodded. Rage burned inside, he called Kate. "You lied to us!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate was shocked. "What did I lie about?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "You've been using us, making us risk our lives. The exploration team, the cure, it's all fake!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Why would I do that? You are overthinking things." Kate paused. <br>
			 <br>
			 "I have evidence. Your research of the Death Virus has nothing to do with a cure!" Yang Dian said. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Not true. You guys must've heard some strange rumors." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Still lying to us, huh?" Yan Dian said the project serial number. <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate went silent for a while, then he replied. "So what? What can you possibly do?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "I..." Yang Dian was furious, but he couldn't say anything. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Humph, 'superhero'!" Kate hung up the call. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian froze as he held the phone. His aura changed. <br>
			 <br>
			 Ned felt a chill. "Are you alright?" <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian shook his head, and put down the phone. "I'm alright, Why wouldn't I be? Hehe." <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			 The institue was in a mess, and the officials were forcing a smile as they negotiated with the military. <br>
			 <br>
			Kate was annoyed. He didn't expect this as no one dared mess with them before. There were many banks backing them, and anyone who stroke the tiger's beard faced it's wrath. There
			'd be no escape. <br>
			 <br>
			After contacting their backers, they were all furious. He called himself a Germinal executive officer, and wore an advanced mech, it was too convincing. The Germinal was a mouse
			crossing the street, everyone wished to beat them, so it wouldn't matter how many enemies they made. It was possible they were throwing the helve after the hatchet. <br>
			 <br>
			The banks ordered the Western Continent intelligence to search for him, and funded the mission through military donations to the Six Nations. There were drugs they urgently neede
			d. <br>
			 <br>
			Kate didn't bother riling himself up any more by meeting those superheroes, and he didn't mind them finding the truth. Because superheroes weren't so petty to take revenge over t
			his. <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao took of the mech, changed his face, and went into a crowd. <br>
			 <br>

			 <br>
			 Han Xiao waited a bit, but there were no new rewards. That's it? What do I need a good impression with them for? <br>
			 <br>
			 They weren't anyone important. Han Xiao was speechless. He would've preferred 100 XP over this! <br>
			 <br>
			 Never mind, it's just a low-level mission. The real rewards are these drugs. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao chuckled as he looked at the backpack in his hands. <br>
			 <br>
			 He stole... that's wrong, he acqueisced almost every type of drug they had. <br>
			 <br>
			 He checked into a random hotel, and checked if there were any surveillance cameras. None. He took out the drugs, and arranged them in rows. <br>
			 <br>
			 Let's see if there's any good stuff. Han Xiao rubbed his hands. He heard one would be lucky if one's hands were heated. <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 Green Lizard Drug (Medium Concentration, 23.3%): Made from Green Lizard Genes. A lazy being. Drinking this will calm you. <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao stunned for three seconds. Then he stood up, and threw it to the floor. <br>
			 <br>
			 Green, my ass! What's even the point of this drug?! I would've been luckier if I warmed my feet! <br>
			 <br>
			 Looking at the drugs, Han Xiao felt a black cloud of bad luck was above his head. <br>
			 <br>
			 Let's hope the others were worthwhile. <br>
			 <br>
			 He went through them all, and there were a total of 34 types. None were as useless as the Green Lizard drug. <br>
			 <br>
			 Some were really good. <br>
			 <br>
			 There was a higher concentration Death Virus Enhancement Drug, the permanent attribute boost was great, and the chance to awaken the rare talent was 3x higher. <br>
			 <br>

			 There were three types: temporary enhancement, disease spreading, and permanent enhancment. <br>
			 <br>
			 Some of the permanent enhancment drugs were one-use, some limited-use. Eagle Predator Drug, the former, Death Virus Drug, the latter. <br>
			 <br>
			 That's why players were passionate about the Forbidden Zone, and the BOSS. Usually, it was a competition between large guilds. <br>

			<p>The talent wasn't a Molding ability, but it made Han Xiao tankier. <br>
			 <br>
			 He recalled Hila had a passive heal, too. But Extraordinary Physique gave 300 HP on top of it. <br>
			 <br>
			As a Mechanic, is it good to be this tanky? Han Xiao didn't know whether to laugh, or cry. This forced him to fight head-on, and he felt, if he continued like this, his style wou
			ld shatter. <br>
			 <br>
			 I just wanna be a Mechanic. Close combat is for savages! <br>
			 <br>
			 He wished to find an attack talent, or creation talent, but those Molding abilities were too rare. The most common were defensive, and enhancement! <br>
			 <br>
			Mechanics needed talents that matched their weapons. He hoped to get the [Lethal Shot] talent, because although not a Molding ability, it had good effects. But the requirement wa
			s to deal high damage to targets at the same, or higher level than his, 50 times. It was at 40, but enemies at his level were hard to find, so he had to spend time to do so. <br>
			 <br>
			 As for the temp enhancements, he planned to put them in the mech's rapid injection module, and sell the rest. <br>
			 <br>
			 Among the drugs, though, one was incomplete, and only had a single syringe. <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 Unknown Drug: Semi-finished product, unknown effects. <br>

			 <br>
			 It looked like water. Han Xiao held an inkling this thing wasn't so simple, but he wouldn't make himself a test subject. <br>
			 <br>
			 Louis Research Institute will complete the research in the future, and I can 'acqueisce' it whenever. <br>
			 <br>
			To create drugs, and learn potions, you had to be the class, [Pharmacist]. Han Xiao wasn't interested in making potions, or wasting class slots, and potions, and drugs were diffe
			rent from machines. Potions demanded material ratios, and specific processes, a tiny mistake would cause failure, whereas machines were a channeling process. <br>
			 <br>
			In the afternoon, Han Xiao snuck out of Kaylos. There was another threatening mission in Maple, Bennett wanted him to scare some government officials in the capital. Reconnaissan
			ce were already on standby in Maple Leaf. <br>
			 <br>
			 The capital was called Karimochi, meaning the 'City of Maple Leaf.' <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			The banks behind the Louis Institute issued a bounty on the Dark Net. The target was 'Heisenberg,' and it was the face Han Xiao used, and a video of him running out of the buildi
			ng in a mech. <br>
			 <br>
			 Germinal soon received this info. <br>
			 <br>
			 "There's no one like that in our organization." <br>
			 <br>
			 The leader was startled. This 'Heisenberg' was a fake, and used Germinal as a cover. It wasn't to frame them, because framing Germinal was unnecessary. <br>
			 <br>
			 Everyone took Germinal lightly now that they retreated, like a tiger without it's fangs. Who was this Heisenberg? <br>
			 <br>
			 The leader focused on the mech. It had tech more advanced than what Germinal was working on. Even the Super Soldier project didn't have this level of practicality. <br>
			 <br>
			 If we can find this mech, our combat ability will skyrocket. Which organization invented this? If it was our enemy... <br>
			 <br>
			 The leader ordered, "Inform our intelligence network to pay attention to this mech user. I want to know his every move." <br>
			 <br>
			 However, this was the only time Han Xiao was recorded using the mech. The intelligence agents were unable to gather any info. <br>
			 <br>
			 The organization definitely had strong backing. <br>
			 <br>
			 The leader felt he discovered the tip of an iceberg of a hidden organization, but they didn't have any leads. <br>
			 <br>
			 He calmed himself, and asked, "How many Inhumans have been captured?" <br>
			 <br>
			The assistant took out the archives. "We have captured 2,103 Inhumans. In the beginning, they were gathered at a few fixed points, but they actively escaped capture, and spread a
			cross the region. Our mission has hit an obstacle, because more are escaping as time goes on." <br>

			"Cyberlos has a new theory from the experiments. Even if they aren't brainwashed, they will accept most requests, and they have very strong will. They don't have much common sens
			e, their dialect is off, and they seem to have a communication network, as some Inhumans know each other. We are still investigating, but we have yet to get results. As Cyberlos
			put it, these Inhumans are like time travelers from the past." <br>
			 <br>
			 "What is the stance of the Six Nations?", the leader asked. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Our intelligence network shows the Six Nations sending people for contact. Different nations had different attitudes." <br>
			 <br>
			The leader nodded. He went silent for a second, then said, "They've halted war preparations, but it won't last forever. Agents from every country are already in Andrea, find them
			, and put them under surveillance. I have a feeling these Inhumans will be the key to our victory in this war." <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			A luxurious villa reflected one sunglasses. Secret service agents wearing civilian clothes patrolled the area. An old man who looked like a beggar pushed up his sunglasses, and f
			idgeted with what was in his ear. <br>
			 <br>
			"Duplex, four-floor villa. The manor door opens from the inside. Two secret service teams patrolling the outside, one inside, a total of eighteen agents. Every morning, he leaves
			 at 8 am sharp in a bulletproof car. Two teams follow, and he has lunch at the restaurant in the government building. <br>
			 <br>
			 Hannes whispered. "He lives in Maple's political neighbourhood. Patrolling police, and sentries pack the street. You'd better be quick about it." <br>
			 <br>
			 A woman, Vernina, talked through the headset. "This reminds me of the old days." <br>
			 <br>
			"I must be mad," Hannes said. "Damn it, Garian, why'd you have to get me into this? Why didn't you ask Bennett? He's still on the front lines, but you had to ask this old man. Co
			uldn't you let me enjoy a few retirement years?" <br>
			 <br>
			"Humph, you owe me a favor, and I don't like Bennett. He sent three bullets through me 33 years ago." Another voice popped in the headset. Garian's voice was like a cannon, "Anyw
			ay, stop complaining like a woman. Has doing nothing, and gardening softened you?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Gentlemen, did you forget there was a woman here?", Vernina said. <br>
			 <br>
			 "I'm sixty, and you're one year older than me. It's not normal to think about fighting, and killing all day at your age." Hannes was shocked. <br>
			 <br>
			"Humph, I haven't hit seventy, so I'm not old yet." Garian complained in the earpiece for a bit, then went to business. "In nine, a patrol will come around the corner. Stay hidde
			n." <br>
			 <br>
			 Hannes leaned forward, and his aura cloaked itself. A patrol came around the corner, and saw Hannes. <br>
			 <br>
			 He yelled, "Identification check!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Hannes took out his fake ID, the officer glanced at it, and returned it, "No loitering. Move along." <br>
			 <br>
			 Hannes walked like an old man around a corner, then ran. He whispered, "There are too many patrols, and sentries. It'd be best to kidnap him at night." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Come back first. We'll discuss the plan then," Garian said. <br></p>

			<p>It was gloomy in the Western Continent. It rained out the shaky train windows, and after a few days, Han Xiao arrived at the capital of Maple, Maple Leaf. <br>
			 <br>
			Maple's population density was low, houses were cheap, and their average size was large; even the middle class could afford a villa. The civilians had a high average income. The
			government would chase the beggars, and poor to other cities yearly, and Maple Leaf was peaceful, and comfortable. Trees lined the roads' centers, and lawns were dark green. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao was smuggled in, and followed the map to a villa. It was a safe house the Dark Net bought, and the contacts were waiting inside. <br>
			 <br>
			It was three storeys, and the door was gray-glazed wood with exquisite carvings. Han Xiao knocked the door knocker to their secret code, and the door opened. An old, female butle
			r with more wrinkles than an expired orange invited him in. <br>
			 <br>
			 After entering, the old long-term resident contact, closed the door behind. "They are waiting in the basement." <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao nodded. He went behind the staircase, and opened the hidden door in a cabinet. He walked down, and it wasn't as dark as he imagined; it was bright. Surrounded by metal w
			alls, equipment, and firearms lay about. And in the corner, there was a lathe, and material case. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao changed his face to Black Phantom, as he saw the two contacts sat at the meeting table in the center. They both turned to him. <br>
			 <br>
			 Golden Fox, and a young man. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Black Phantom?", she said. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao's eyes brightened. He laughed. and said, "Oh, it's you. You've become prettier." <br>
			 <br>
			 Golden Fox was frightened. She covered her face, and said in her head: Stop, I beg you! <br>
			 <br>
			 The other contact in his twenties. His code name was 'Ghost Blade,' and he was a scorpion, the lowest rank, and a new member. He stared at Han Xiao with doubt. <br>
			 <br>
			Ghost Blade trained in Raylen, but he escaped before graduation. Naturally, he felt a superior to these underground killers. He joined the Blood Pact Society around the time Han
			Xiao did, but Han Xiao was already a legend compared to him. He wasn't really convinced. <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao didn't have much experience, but he became the ace of Blood Pact Society. There was a group of proud contracters who were unconvinced, most of which versed in other thin
			gs before becoming a killer. There'd always be those in doubt until they saw it themselves. <br>
			 <br>
			 "I've heard about you. They say you're a legend, but it seems you're nothing special," Ghost Blade said. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao glanced at Ghost Blade, but couldn't be bothered. <br>
			 <br>
			Golden Fox cut in. "Ahem! We have five targets: Harry Reymen, Sennin Miller, Billy Angus, Dick Van Vancity, Dorasi Farami. All government officials who opposed the plan. Guards f
			ollow them 24/7." <br>
			 <br>
			 Ghost Blade snorted, and laid out a map on the table. "This is the terrain map of the target's villa. The guard, and patrol routes are marked." <br>
			 <br>
			The data was very detailed. Ghost Blade's ability to collect intelligence was a textbook example following the booklet of Raylen. He collected every detail there was, and with th
			e secret knowledge he held, Golden Fox didn't need to help with data gathering. Amateurs were on a different level. <br>
			 <br>
			 Ghost Blade glanced at Han Xiao. He was confident such detailed intel would surprise him...but Han Xiao kept a straight face. <br>
			 <br>
			Ghost Blade frowned, "This is your action plan. You see the red lines, and marks? These are the action routes, and as long as you follow my plan, and don't make any mistakes, you
			 will succeed. You understand what I wrote? These are special symbols used by agents, so if you don't understand, I can help." <br>
			 <br>
			 "No need, I'll look myself." Han Xiao read the intel thoroughly, then asked, "What's the mission?" <br>
			 <br>
			"Place the docs in the targets' homes, somewhere obvious ensuring they see. Inside, there's some evidence...and they won't like it. As long as we put these in the house without a
			nyone noticing, they will know they aren't safe," Golden Fox said. <br>
			 <br>
			 "What will you guys do?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "I'm responsible for intelligence, so carrying it out is your mission as an ace. Don't think about seeking my help," Ghost Blade snorted. <br>
			 <br>
			 Golden Fox gave Ghost Blade a stare, then said, "If you need back up, I can help." <br>
			 <br>
			 "There's no need." Han Xiao waved his hand. "It looks pretty easy, so I'll do it alone." <br>
			 <br>
			"It is very easy following my plan." Ghost Blade nodded. He left out some intelligence in the data. It wouldn't affect the mission, but it would give him some challenge. He wante
			d to test out this 'Black Phantom,' and although he was the ace of the organization, he'd still be cold towards him if he can't do this. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao looked at the papers, and shook his head. "This plan is too complicated. I'll do it my way." <br>
			 <br>
			 Ghost Blade replied, "This was the fruit of my careful research of all the intelligence, and you can come up with a plan better than mine in a few minutes?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "This mission isn't challenging at all," Han Xiao said. <br>
			 <br>
			Quit messing around! Ghost Blade snorted with anger, and walked out of the room. Why wouldn't Black Phantom just follow his plan? He was a professional, and his plan was perfect;
			 Black Phantom had no idea of what he was doing. <br>
			 <br>
			He'll slip up if he doesn't follow my plan, Ghost Blade thought. He sat back down. Not following his plan was basically screwing around, so Black Phantom had better meant what he
			 said. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao looked at his watch. "I'll act tonight. You guys just wait." <br>
			 <br>
			 The two contacts weren't involved in the field, and Han Xiao didn't need support. It was Han Xiao acting alone. <br>
			 <br>
			 "He's only just arrived, and he's already going. How impulsive." Ghost Blade shook his head. This mission was going to fail. <br>
			 <br>
			 Not listening to professionals always resulted in failure. <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			Night arrived, and clouds covered the moon. Han Xiao changed into a black outfit, and locked his stuff in the safehouse. He reset the password, and brought along the necessary eq
			uipment. <br>
			 <br>
			 The streets were quiet. Wind shook the trees' leaves, and a natural fragrance came from the gardens. There were a few people on the street, but most were patrolling police. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao walked along quiet streets, and arrived at the political neighbourhood. Patrols grew in number, so he hid in an alley, and waited for them to pass. <br>
			 <br>
			 About ten minutes passed, and a patrol walked toward the alley. <br>
			 <br>
			 "B3248, Clear," he put the walkie talkie by his waist. He looked into the dark alley. <br>
			 <br>
			 Arms grabbed, and dragged him into darkness. His yelling only lasted a second. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao changed into a police uniform, and his face was the policeman's. <br></p>
