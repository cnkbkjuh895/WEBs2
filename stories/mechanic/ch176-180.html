			<p>"The beasts are killing each other." <br>
			 <br>
			 The two smiled. <br>
			 <br>
			The beasts killed for half an hour, corpses lay everywhere. And the lion was the last alive. It's fur was blood red, and it growled at the other beasts. They backed away, and lef
			t. <br>
			 <br>
			 The herd was gone, but the strongest still clawed at the hole. The opening widened, Yang Dian, and Ned had nowhere to hide. <br>
			 <br>
			 Their hearts sank. Ned bit his lips, and said, "Your wounds... Be the bait, and I'll leave alive." <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian looked down. "I won't be able to run. Take care of my family for me..." <br>
			 <br>
			 "I will. I'll take care of your child, and your wife." <br>
			 <br>
			 They looked at each other, and at his wounds. Then they gave a bitter smile. <br>
			 <br>
			 "If we're going to die...we'll die together." <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian stood up, leaning against the stone wall, and said, "We'll use everything we have." <br>
			 <br>
			 Ned nodded. White light came from his hands as he stood. <br>
			 <br>
			 Outside, blue light shot along the night sky, and hit the lion's eye. Blood splat across it's face, and a gunshot resounded. <br>
			 <br>
			 It roared, and sprinted off. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian, and Ned were stunned. "Our savior!" <br>
			 <br>
			 500 meters off, Han Xiao lay prone, blue light surging along Ghost's circuits. <br>
			 <br>
			 In the sniper scope, the lion rushed toward him. It's eye squirted blood, and half it's face was splattered in blood. <br>
			 <br>
			Flaming Will triggered 2.2x damage, together with [Overload], vital attack, and sneak attack damage. An astonishing 1,800! This was the highest damage Han Xiao had dealt in a sin
			gle shot. <br>
			 <br>
			However, it was still alive, and well. Han Xiao looked at the interface, and as he expected, the white lion was it. The Beast King. It's display name was Mutant, White Lion King,
			 at LV 56. It had specialty abilities, it's health was a horrifying 18,000. <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 Mutant White Lion King <br>
			 Level: 56 <br>
			 Health: 15,724/18,700 <br>
			 Status: -50% Field of View, Moderate Bleeding <br>
			 Attributes: 135 STR, 126 DEX, 240 END, 30 INT, 22 MYS, 31 CHA, 24 LUK <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			It's attributes were high, and it had many special abilities, including [Crazed Rage], enhancing movement speed, attack speed, and damage, in relation to health decreases. Extrem
			ely dangerous. <br>
			 <br>
			 This BOSS was supposed to be fought as a team. However, with his mech, the risk wasn't too high. <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao jumped backwards, firing. Despite wearing Viper, he avoided close-range combat. Mixing combat strategies was the right way to go. By using a sniper, and mech, he had an
			advantage in both close, and ranged combat. The scanner analyzed the terrain, and jumped backwards automatically, giving his full attention to firing. <br>
			 <br>
			 After kiting, Han Xiao's emptied all his clips, and the Lion King was within 100 meters. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao stopped, and dashed forward. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Combat Mode!" Han Xiao yelled. <br>
			 <br>
			 Electricity flew through the cables. The Bonfire Reaction Furnace shone bright red, and his muscle fibers pulsed. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao clenched his fist. He felt the mech's power just waiting to be let out. <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian, and Ned watched as Han Xiao faced the Lion King head-on. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Don't fight it close range!" They shouted. <br>
			 <br>
			 This mysterious person was there to save them, he was their hope, but he might end up the same as Yan Dian. <br>
			 <br>
			 Such a small human, yet he chose to face this enormous beast! A pebble to a stone! <br>
			 <br>
			 They clashed, the result was certain in their minds. They wanted to shut their eyes, and not see what was coming to that man. <br>
			 <br>
			 But the man didn't suffer much at all, rather the white lion was growling in pain. The Lion King was knocked back, and the ground under Han Xiao was crushed. He was on par! <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao's mech was light, he only held still by the strength put into the mech's legs. Han Xiao leaped, and swung his leg into the side of the lion's head. It struck, and a ripp
			le shot the air. <br>
			 <br>
			The white lion's skull bent. It flew, and</p>

			<h3 class="center three-hs">Chapter 177 - The 'Inhuman' Phenomenon<br>Translator: Atlas Studios, Editor: Atlas Studios<br>Fan Editor: Catosc</h3>
			<p class="center">////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><br>
			<p>The Lion King pounced at Han Xiao. <br>
			 <br>
			 He raised his hand, and a blast of air shot, knocking the Lion King back. The Field Repulsive Machine. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao's energy levels were decreasing with the many modules active at once, but it's health was low. 30%. <br>
			 <br>
			 The Lion King howled to the sky, and it's skin dyed red. Rage Mode, it's second phase. Han Xiao felt it's bursting pressure. <br>
			 <br>
			 I can't fight close-range during Rage Mode. Han Xiao retreated a distance. For the time being, his combat mode was strike, and retreat. <br>
			 <br>
			 The Lion King chased, but it was sluggish. It must be exhausted. <br>
			 <br>
			 [Flaming Will]'s cooldown ended, and Han Xiao lifted Ghost, and shot. It's other eye was the target.. <br>
			 <br>
			 4.1x Damage! It was the highest multiplier he'd ever seen from [Overload]! Lucky! <br>
			 <br>
			 The only eye the Lion King had burst, and sprayed blood onto the grass. It swayed, and hit the ground. <br>
			 <br>
			"It's defeated!" Han Xiao sighed. Viper was better than expected, it covered a Mechanic's weakness of low physical attributes, not mentioning it's extensive functionality in most
			 aspects. <br>
			 <br>
			Viper was the basis of a second combat strategy. Like how his sniping slowly improved, his mechanical suit needed more modules. This was just the beginning. And this battle was j
			ust a test to find a plan for improvements. There was room for improvement in both it's combat, and stealth abilities. <br>
			 <br>
			 The lion was immobilized, so Han Xiao walked over, and stabbed it in it's heart. It was the size of a basketball, violet-colored nerves, hot like a fireball. <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 You received a special item, [Mutated Heart]. <br>
			 <br>
			 You have triggered mission, [Virus Research]! <br>
			 <br>
			Mission Introduction: Beasts in the area are infected by Death Virus, and certain organizations are searching for large samples. That's right, I'm talking about that heart you've
			 got. <br>
			 <br>
			 Mission Requirement: Give [Mutated Heart] to Louis Biological Research Institution within 7 days. <br>
			 <br>
			 Reward: Death Virus Drug, x1 <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 The mission was for bonus reward related to the heart. The drug could increase one's attributes, and there was a small chance of gaining a rare talent ability. <br>
			 <br>
			 In his previous life, the Beast King BOSS was killed within hours of spawning, since the quest was infinite, and the largest guilds controlled the area to grind the drug. <br>
			 <br>
			 Louis Biological Research Institution, in Maple, was open to the public, and players exchanged many strange materials for drugs not any less strange. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao pulled a suitcase, holding liquid nitrogen, and placed the heart inside. He heard footsteps. Yang Dian, and Ned walked forward, taking a few steps at a time. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Thanks for saving us," Yang Dian said. He couldn't see Han Xiao's face through the mask. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao was silent. He checked his inventory, and left. Beasts were coming soon, the blood stench was too strong. Plus, he needed a place to rest. <br>
			 <br>
			 The duo looked at each other, then ran to Han Xiao, introducing themselves. They said, "We came here searching for an exploration team. They went deep into the zone to find the v
			 irus' cure, and have lost contact. We hope you can help." <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 You triggered Grade D Mission, [Save the exploration team]. <br>
			 <br>
			 Accept, or reject? <br>
			 <br>
			 _____________________ <br>
			 <br>
			 "Reject." <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao changed his voice electronically. "Don't bother me." <br>
			 <br>
			 It'd mean taking a group across the forbidden zone. They were too weak, success was unlikely, and every second would increase the danger. Han Xiao's goal was the mutated heart, t
			 hus, there was no need for him to waste his time. <br>
			 <br>
			 "They're in danger, because they wished to stop the virus. How can you not help!?" Ned said. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao switched on his hover shoes, and left without a reply. It was clear what he meant. Don't drag me into this. <br>
			 <br>
			 The duo watched as Han Xiao left. <br>
			 <br>
			 Not everyone was kind, and they knew that, but they still clenched their fists. They couldn't bring along such a strong person. <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao left the Forbidden Zone, and jumped in the cargo plane. He stripped the mechanical suit, and sighed from relief. <br>
			 <br>
			 Viper was amazing, he was satisfied with the results. <br>
			 <br>
			 The plane left for Maple, to Louis Biological Research Institution to exchange the heart. He also planned to do a mission there, a contact from the Blood Pact Society was in Mapl
			 e. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao looked at the briefing on his laptop. <br>
			 <br>
			 My contact is a hitman? Wait, this name looks familiar, Golden Fox? Do I know them? <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao raised his brows. Putting the matter aside, he opened the forum, because his focus were the players. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao had two novice villages in the Western Continent left. New players had already reached an average level of ten. By then, many left to explore the map, but because of Han
			 Xiao, some players stayed, waiting. <br>
			 <br>
			 He felt great. His actions affected many players' actions, all because of the recent popularity boost. <br>
			 <br>
			 Scrolling the forums, some posts attracted his attention. They were players from Andrea, and they were all complaining. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Question, why is the Germinal Organization coming to novice villages, and taking us?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "I've been brainwashed, my faction is locked, and I've lost relationship points. Why?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "An NPC sliced me to pieces, then asked of my origins." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Same!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Is this part of the storyline? But I didn't get any alerts." <br>
			 <br>
			 Players recorded Germinal capturing novice players. Armed soldiers placed handcuffs on players. The ones that resisted were shot by paralysis bullets. <br>
			 <br>
			 Cuffed players were crammed in the back of a truck. They were squeezed together, and the only light they saw was through barred windows. <br>
			 <br>
			 They were taken to Germinal bases. Their bases, unlike other factions', were hidden. All headquarters in Andrea were massive, with extremely tight defense. <br>
			 <br>
			 Andrea was brown, and from a satellite, the Germinal bases were black dots, like a spreading virus. This forsaken land was abundant with radiation, and dirt. Germinal stole old r
			 uins, and inherited them, including prior military sites. <br>
			 <br>
			 The Inhuman Incident had started. Han Xiao's eyes twinkled. He experienced this before, and it was the hottest topic at the time. <br>
			 <br>
			 NPCs' curiosity towards players was the core of Galaxy, it was part of the storyline. Different planets had different approaches to players, and Aquamarine was the first planet t
			 o notice. <br>
			 <br>
			 Before, Han Xiao was just an onlooker. Now, it was different, and he felt he could figure something out. <br>
			 <br>
			 Germinal lost all secondary bases, so the number of players joining would be fewer, but they've realized the damage caused. <br>
			 <br>
			 Imagining their leader's anger made Han Xiao happy. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao opened his laptop, and browsed info on the Dark Net. Many organizations had noticed the players, and they were intrigued. <br>
			 <br>
			 The Six Nations may make a move soon, which would delay the expedition war, but it would still be earlier than my previous life. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. An earlier war gave him advantages, and disadvantages. Advantages being the players weren't strong enough to make a large impact in the war, which red
			 uced the chaos. As long as the players didn't interfere, Germinal would be unilaterally crushed. <br>
			 <br>
			 Now, the war would soon enter the climax, without the players' involvement. <br></p>

			<p>--Stardragon's Western Capital, Division 13 Headquarters-- <br>
			 <br>
			The Vice-Chairman, Gu Hui, and all of Division 13's leaders gathered in the meeting room. Gu Hui pressed a button under the table, and the doors, and windows shut. Full-iron cove
			ring all exits, with all surveillance shut off. <br>
			 <br>
			Gu Hui looked serious. He distributed the documents to everyone. On the documents were authorization stamps given by top officials, meaning they were confidential. The Inhuman Ob
			servation Files. <br>
			 <br>
			"Five days from now, rumors of the existence of these Inhumans spread on the Dark Net. After an investigation, they were confirmed to exist. These Inhumans appeared in every cont
			inent, spreading like a virus, and their origins are unknown." <br>
			 <br>
			"The information on the Dark Net list their characteristics as such," Their info on players was similar in scope to Germinal's info. They knew the players disappeared without war
			ning, were immortal, and one last point. "In our observations, their average strength is low. Thus, their threat is minor." <br>
			 <br>
			 "If we don't suppress it, this could spread, and cause a disaster," one person said. <br>
			 <br>
			 Gu Hui nodded. "The top officials have given a command. Contact is our priority." <br>
			 <br>
			 "About the expedition...an army has been prepared, and our supplies are in check. We can head to Andrea at any time." <br>
			 <br>
			"Our superiors have come to an agreement with the other nations, we will halt the expedition. We must first understand these Inhumans; it is a higher potential threat." Gu Hui Kn
			ocked the table, he looked at everyone, and said, "Get some Inhumans on our side. Be friendly." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Agents are undercover in Andrea. Should we call them back?", the Head of Field Operations asked. <br>
			 <br>
			"No need, they will gain more intelligence. We have enough manpower as is," Gu Hui said. "When we have a conclusion, the officials may even seek helps from the Galactic Civilizat
			ions." <br>
			 <br>
			 ... <br>
			 <br>
			As the players increased in level, their actions attracted the attention of the organizations. The Six Nations, Vagrants, Dark Net, and most large financial organizations were pa
			ying attention to the Inhumans. They sent people to contact them, varying in approach. Some friendly, some not, but the exception was Germinal. They captured swaths of players in
			 Andrea, forcing beginner players out of novice villages. <br>
			 <br>
			For players, which organization they joined wouldn't make a difference, but they'd resist if forced. Germinal left a bad impression on players, and for the captured, they had to
			accept their fate. <br>
			 <br>
			Players in Andrea had a tough time. Their game experience was poor, but it made players very curious. Why were these NPCs surprised about their existence? These acted like real p
			eople would. <br>
			 <br>
			 More organizations contacted players. The players made guesses about the situation, and the topic soon became the most popular on the forum. <br>
			 <br>
			 Only happening on Aquamarine, many players visited the Aquamarine site, making it the most visited planet site of all novice planets. <br>
			 <br>
			 There were hundreds of posts a second; it's popularity was astonishing. <br>
			 <br>
			All kinds of speculations popped up. The most accepted theory was the Electrolux theory, but the game developers didn't give a response. Players could only guess, many of which w
			ere out there. <br>
			 <br>
			 "We purposely reincarnated to conquer a new world for our gods, serial number A12651 reporting for duty!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Bullshit, we're Earth's army, conquering alternative dimensions. Our mission is an honorable one." <br>
			 <br>
			 "798 Space Fleet of the Earth Association. Commander Blacky is ready for deployment. Victory to Earth!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "You're all wrong. Our earth is an illusion, and this is the real reality." <br>
			 <br>
			 "You youngsters are far too naive. This is all part of the Elde's schemes!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "This marks the first step to Skynet's take-over. One day, our minds will be locked in the game." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Hail Hydra!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Commenter above is in the wrong universe!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Sigh, I'm a retired soldier of the 1999 clan wars. Thinking of it now, that was a dark age." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Grandpapi sure has a strong body, playing Full Dive VR games into his later years." <br>
			 <br>
			 The ridiculous speculations became a joke that trended on the forum. <br>
			 <br>
			 Organizations contacting players was beneficial. It was easier for players to pick a faction to join...except for players in Andrea who were being captured. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao followed the situation. He had info from both the Dark Net, and the forum, both the NPCs, and players. Combined, he had more than both. <br>
			 <br>
			 And the mindset of both were very different. The organizations were serious, while the players were having fun. <br>
			 <br>
			 Interesting. <br>
			 <br>
			 The influence of the Inhumans was growing as the organizations found more info about the players. And the pros should've gotten opportunities by now. <br>
			 <br>
			 Aquamarine was China's base, so there would've been some meeting an opportunity unlike others'. The storyline was on the right path. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao rushed to Maple, as the mission was timed. <br>
			 <br>
			 Louis Research Institution was in Kaylos city. It wasn't near the border, so Han Xiao had to travel two days by car after being smuggled in. <br>
			 <br>
			Maple felt lifeless. It's rigid political system, uneven wealth distribution. Resources were tightly controlled by politicians, and the lower class had limited opportunities to g
			ain wealth. "Barely living. Just waiting 'til death," was the best way to describe Maple citizens. <br>
			 <br>
			Long-faced pedestrians passed by. Han Xiao rubbed his face, looking at the light grey roads, filled with potholes, and cracks. He felt such a handsome face like his didn't fit in
			 with the state of these people...and their faces. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao changed his face again, and put on spectacles. Nobody would recognize him now. <br>
			 <br>
			Louis Research Institution building was a silver sky-scraper. The people inside wore white labcoats, probably worried others didn't know they were doing important technological r
			esearch. <br>
			 <br>
			 A lady walked to Han Xiao with a well-mannered smile. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Hi, do you wish for an introduction to the business scope of Louis Group Companies?" <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao raised the metal suitcase, and said, "I have the heart of a Death Virus infected. One of your researchers may be interested." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Please wait a moment, I'll inform a superior." The receptionist brought him to a sofa, and left. <br>
			 <br>
			 Louis Research Institution accepted outside research projects, so there were always customers coming in. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao scanned the hall. It was built like a sphere, it looked like a hotel hall. <br>
			 <br>
			 After a bit, two people covered in bandages walked in. Han Xiao raised his head, the smell of blood. It was the not so superhero duo he met in the Forbidden Zone. <br>
			 <br>
			 They were searching for an exploration team. So the team was from Louis Research Institution. <br>
			 <br>
			 Looks like they failed. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao raised his brows, but stayed put. They wouldn't recognize him anyway. <br></p>

			<p class="center">////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><br>
			<p>Yang Dian, and Ned were frustrated. It was Louis Research Institution that gave the rescue mission. After Han Xiao left, they searched far, and they found them in the valley wher
			e they lost contact. <br>
			 <br>
			 However, bone spurs pierced their flesh, and they lost their minds, attacking anything in sight. They were far gone. <br>
			 <br>
			 The leader of the team held a tiny part of his sanity, and handed the duo a suitcase. Supposedly, it contained an important material for a cure to the Death Virus. <br>
			 <br>
			 The duo had no choice. They were attacked by a herds of beasts, they protected the suitcase with all they had, and escaped with it undamaged. <br>
			 <br>
			Yang Dian, and Ned sat their exhausted bodies on the plane, and came to Kaylos feeling horrible. They couldn't save them, and were soon to be blamed, as they didn't live up to th
			e trust they were given. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Mr. Kate, we failed the mission..." Ned said. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Are they all dead?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Sorry, they were infected. We couldn't do anything." Yang Dian couldn't look in Kate's grief-stricken eyes. <br>
			 <br>
			 "It's not your fault." <br>
			 <br>
			Kate took off his spectacles, and rubbed his eyes. This didn't make them feel any better. Ned took out the suitcase. "Their leader asked us to deliver this. It's important materi
			al, it can help a cure!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate took it. "Sigh, I wish they made it back. This was their accomplishment, and we'll never forget it. If we can make a cure, we will name it after them." <br>
			 <br>
			 Yang Dian sighed. "They're heroes. Failing to save them is a regret I'll have for life." <br>
			 <br>
			"Don't feel guilty. Their hard work was paid off, because you guys helped. You've done what you can, and you shouldn't blame yourselves for that. We'll take care of your wounds w
			ithout charge," Kate said. <br>
			 <br>
			 "You can't. I don't want to trouble you any further." The more hospitality shown, the sorrier they felt. They rejected it, and walked out of the place. <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate pushed up his spectacles as he watched them leave. He walked over to Han Xiao with a smile. "Greetings, what's your business with the Research Institute?" <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao returned the smile, and opened his suitcase. <br>
			 <br>
			 "A Death Virus infected heart from a very strong beast." <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate's eyes sparkled, and his smile widened, "Please, follow me." <br>
			 <br>
			Kate led him into an elevator, and they went up to the thirteenth floor. The doors opened, and they walked a long, white corridor. The walls were covered in windows, and inside w
			ere labs. Some were occupied, some had machines, and materials. Up ahead, a few researchers were chatting. <br>
			 <br>
			This floor was for experiments. As they walked, Kate said, "The Death Virus is very important research. We ran into many obstacles, and met our limits, because we didn't have eno
			ugh live samples. This heart is very important; we'll make a drug out of it right away, and give dose to you once completed. Or if you want other rewards..." <br>
			 <br>
			 "No need, I want the drug." Han Xiao pointed at the suitcase in Kate's hands. "You already have material, don't you?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "This? Hehe...well, this is important, too." Kate didn't explain further. <br>
			 <br>
			 They stopped outside a large, biological lab. "Please wait outside. Unauthorized personnel are not allowed in." <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao gave the suitcase, and Kate walked in with both suitcases, saying something to the supervisor. He opened them on the table, and in the duo's was an egg. Han Xiao was uns
			ure what creature it was from. <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate, and the supervisor whispered, but Han Xiao's LV 55 senses couldn't be stopped. <br>
			 <br>
			 "What happened to them. Are they all dead?", the supervisor asked. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Yes," Kate replied, "They couldn't save them." <br>
			 <br>
			 "At least, they brought it. Never mind their deaths, with this heart, we can make the drug very soon. What did the heroes say exactly?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "They couldn't live up to our trust. Hehe, those heroes are much cheaper than mercenaries. Given a 'virtuous' reason, we might have free labor. Already saved me much money." <br>
			 <br>
			 "No one knows, right?" <br>
			 <br>
			"Of course not, they're all stupid. A few lies, and they were touched. They almost cried. These 'heroes' are the easiest to convince, because a little compliment will make them a
			ll emotional. They were on some 'honorable' quest, but I couldn't hold my laughter." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Don't offend them. Build trust with them." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Don't worry, they had a good impression. If there are any dangerous missions, they're easy to find. They won't reject it as long as we give them some 'virtuous' reason." <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao waited, a stoic expression. <br>
			 <br>
			Kate wrapped it up, and came outside with a smile. "One day until the drug's finished. If you don't mind, we can provide a room for you, and the drug will be given as soon as it'
			s done." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Okay." <br>
			 <br>
			They took the elevator to the residential floor, and Han Xiao opened the door to his guest room. Kate mentioned a few areas prohibited for entry, and said he had something to do.
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao found two cameras in the room. He took out his laptop, and hacked the system, taking control of the cameras in his room, and looped the video. <br>
			 <br>
			 He then hacked into their database to peek at their projects. <br>
			 <br>
			[Elementary Coding] was at it's highest level, so his hacking could get through most firewalls on Aquamarine, except for the Six Nations', Germinals', the core of the Dark Net, a
			nd a few others. A small research institute couldn't stop him. With ease, he didn't trigger an alarm, and erased his traces afterwards. <br>
			 <br>
			 He opened the master projects file, and names popped up on screen. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Green Lizard Potion, Wild Bull Steroid, Thunder Claw Extraction, Stone Plaque Pathogen." <br>
			 <br>
			Many drugs players could receive. After some time, he found the Death Virus project. He clicked on [Death Virus Enhancement Agent]. In it's description, it was an experiment to e
			nhance one's physical abilities...the research institution wasn't doing any research on the cure. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao typed on the keyboard. He had planted a virus. <br></p>

			<p>The next day, Kate came to Han Xiao's room carrying a suitcase. He placed the suitcase on the table, and patted it. "The drug's complete." <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao opened it, and a thick, white gas blew into his face. Inside was a crimson drug. He grabbed it, and info showed on the interface. <br>
			 <br>

			 <br>
			 Such low concentration, they gave me the lowest quality one. He closed the suitcase. <br>
			 <br>
			 "I'm satisfied with this," Han Xiao said with a smile. <br>
			 <br>
			 "I look forward to our next meeting," Kate replied. <br>
			 <br>
			 "No need to look forward to it. I want to buy more; what's your stock?" <br>
			 <br>
			"We provide long-term supplies in bulk to organizations, and renowned customers. If it's a normal customer, however, especially of unknown origin, I'm afraid we can't. We hope yo
			u understand. We can sell to you if you prove your influx of money is enough." <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate made it look like he wanted to agree, but couldn't, because of regulation. However, Han Xiao knew it was most likely to raise the price. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao smiled. He adjusted his collar, and said, "Allow me to introduce myself, I'm an Executive Officer of Germinal, Heisenberg." <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate was surprised. <br>
			 <br>
			 Germinal Organization? Didn't they leave the Western Continent? Is this so-called Heisenberg guy secretly active, or lying? <br>
			 <br>
			 "Forgive me, but your identity is very suspicious." Kate took two steps back, and grabbed the alarm in his pocket. He's trigger it if he tried anything. <br>
			 <br>
			 "No need to be nervous...give me a moment." Han Xiao went in the bathroom. <br>
			 <br>
			 Why is he going to the toilet? Han Xiao walked out in Viper. The highly advanced mech gave Kate a shock. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Wha-what are you...?" <br>
			 <br>
			Han Xiao swung his arms, and said, "This is the latest mech invented by Germinal. If your eyes are functional, you can see it's advanced tech. Even the labs of the Six Nations do
			esn't have these. You don't have to worry; this is a secret project of our organization, and it should prove my identity." <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate's mouth was open, he felt something was off. "But..." <br>
			 <br>
			"I'm aware. There's no Germinal stamp on the mech. Times are tough, and it's very dangerous to have a high profile. I've been given full responsibility in this matter, so if you
			wish to contact a my officials... Sorry, but your position doesn't warrant that," Han Xiao said. He almost believed it himself. <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate hesitated. "I need to discuss this with the others." <br>
			 <br>
			 He sat on the far couch, and opened his laptop. The lab supervisors were surprised by Han Xiao's origins. <br>
			 <br>
			 "There's no proof, so we can't trust him." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Do you want him to shout 'I'm from Germinal' everywhere he goes? I think, there's no need for him to lie. We will know the truth when we trade, anyway." <br>
			 <br>
			 "Makes sense." <br>
			 <br>
			 "But cooperating with them is dangerous..." <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao cut in, "Any trade we make will be confidential. As long as we don't tell a soul, no one will know. We may give financial support for new divisions in Andrea." <br>
			 <br>
			Their eyes brightened. Andrea was radiation-covered, and many flora, and fauna mutated. They had heard about the generosity of Germinal, but the Maple government was corrupt, and
			 they just about had enough. It seemed like a good plan. <br>
			 <br>
			 Even if they didn't move, an Andrea research division was a good idea. <br>
			 <br>
			 "Shall we?" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Bring him to the exhibition room." <br>
			 <br>
			 The discussion ended. Kate said, "We accept the deal, Heisenberg. Please, follow me. I'll show you the results of our research." <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao nodded. He followed Kate into the elevator, and descended two floors. <br>
			 <br>
			The drug exhibition room looked like cold storage from outside. Kate entered a password into the keypad, and the doors slid open. Showcases were on the walls, filled with drugs o
			f various colors. All the drugs were finished with varying concentration. <br>
			 <br>
			 "These are the products in our institute. Which one do you want?" Kate asked. <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao looked around, and said, "All of them. Money isn't an issue, as long as your stock is enough." <br>
			 <br>
			 Joy filled the officials' faces, watching through the camera. Such a large order... <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao raised his eyebrows. "But I will have to verify their effects first." <br>
			 <br>
			 Kate opened a showcase, took out a drug, and gave it to him. Han Xiao read the interface. It was a temporary enhancement drug; it granted +3 Endurance for three minutes. <br>
			 <br>
			 After making sure all were real, Han Xiao said, "I will need it all in bulk." <br>
			 <br>
			Kate received commands through an earpiece. He took out his laptop, and opened the price page. "We have enough inventory. After making the payment, these things will be yours." <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. "I will only make the payment when I see the products." <br>
			 <br>
			"Don't worry, we're just a small organization. We wouldn't have the guts to go against Germinal, so we won't go back on our word. Besides, this is insignificant money for your or
			ganization," Kate said with a smile. <br>
			 <br>
			 Seems like this is as far as I can get. Han Xiao's eyes flashed. He placed the gun on Kate's forehead, and said, "Here's the payment." <br>
			 <br>
			 Pa! <br>
			 <br>
			 The laptop hit the ground. <br>
			 <br>
			 The gun's muzzle made Kate tremble. "You're a fake!" <br>
			 <br>
			 Han Xiao didn't reply. He shot at the showcase. The glass was bulletproof; it cracked, but didn't shatter. <br>
			 <br>
			 In the surveillance room, the officials were shocked. <br>
			 <br>
			 "He wants to take our products!" <br>
			 <br>
			 "Lucky we have the security systems!" <br>
			 <br>
			 The exhibition room's door shut, and the showcases slid into the wall. The room was empty, and the ceiling moved. Three rows of guns uncovered. <br>
			 <br>
			 An official spoke through a speaker. <br>
			 <br>
			"Unexpected, right? We were suspicious of you from the beginning. Now, your life is under our control, and you can't escape. With a press of a button, you will die, and unless yo
			u wish to know how long it will takes to turn you into a pile of gore, drop the guns, take off the mech, and get on your knees. Then you can tell us who sent you." <br></p>
