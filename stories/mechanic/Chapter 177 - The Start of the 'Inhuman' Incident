Chapter 177: The Start of the 'Inhuman' Incident
Translator: Atlas Studios, Editor: Atlas Studios (Fan Editor: Catosc)

The Lion King pounced at Han Xiao.

He raised his hand, and a blast of air shot, knocking the Lion King back. The Field Repulsive Machine.

Han Xiao's energy levels were decreasing with the many modules active at once, but it's health was low. 30%.

The Lion King howled to the sky, and it's skin dyed red. Rage Mode, it's second phase. Han Xiao felt it's bursting pressure.

I can't fight close-range during Rage Mode. Han Xiao retreated a distance. For the time being, his combat mode was strike, and retreat.

The Lion King chased, but it was sluggish. It must be exhausted.

[Flaming Will]'s cooldown ended, and Han Xiao lifted Ghost, and shot. It's other eye was the target..

4.1x Damage! It was the highest multiplier he'd ever seen from [Overload]! Lucky!

The only eye the Lion King had burst, and sprayed blood onto the grass. It swayed, and hit the ground.

"It's defeated!" Han Xiao sighed. Viper was better than expected, it covered a Mechanic's weakness of low physical attributes, not mentioning it's extensive functionality in most aspects.

Viper was the basis of a second combat strategy. Like how his sniping slowly improved, his mechanical suit needed more modules. This was just the beginning. And this battle was just a test to find a plan for improvements. There was room for improvement in both it's combat, and stealth abilities.

The lion was immobilized, so Han Xiao walked over, and stabbed it in it's heart. It was the size of a basketball, violet-colored nerves, hot like a fireball.

You received a special item, [Mutated Heart].

You have triggered mission, [Virus Research]!

Mission Introduction: Beasts in the area are infected by Death Virus, and certain organizations are searching for large samples. That's right, I'm talking about that heart you've got.

Mission Requirement: Give [Mutated Heart] to Louis Biological Research Institution within 7 days.

Reward: Death Virus Drug, x1

_____________________

The mission was for bonus reward related to the heart. The drug could increase one's attributes, and there was a small chance of gaining a rare talent ability.

In his previous life, the Beast King BOSS was killed within hours of spawning, since the quest was infinite, and the largest guilds controlled the area to grind the drug.

Louis Biological Research Institution, in Maple, was open to the public, and players exchanged many strange materials for drugs not any less strange.

Han Xiao pulled a suitcase, holding liquid nitrogen, and placed the heart inside. He heard footsteps. Yang Dian, and Ned walked forward, taking a few steps at a time.

"Thanks for saving us," Yang Dian said. He couldn't see Han Xiao's face through the mask.

Han Xiao was silent. He checked his inventory, and left. Beasts were coming soon, the blood stench was too strong. Plus, he needed a place to rest.

The duo looked at each other, then ran to Han Xiao, introducing themselves. They said, "We came here searching for an exploration team. They went deep into the zone to find the virus' cure, and have lost contact. We hope you can help."

Accept, or reject?

"Reject."

Han Xiao changed his voice electronically. "Don't bother me."

It'd mean taking a group across the forbidden zone. They were too weak, success was unlikely, and every second would increase the danger. Han Xiao's goal was the mutated heart, thus, there was no need for him to waste his time.

"They're in danger, because they wished to stop the virus. How can you not help!?" Ned said.

Han Xiao switched on his hover shoes, and left without a reply. It was clear what he meant. Don't drag me into this.

The duo watched as Han Xiao left.

Not everyone was kind, and they knew that, but they still clenched their fists. They couldn't bring along such a strong person.

...

Han Xiao left the Forbidden Zone, and jumped in the cargo plane. He stripped the mechanical suit, and sighed from relief.

Viper was amazing, he was satisfied with the results.

The plane left for Maple, to Louis Biological Research Institution to exchange the heart. He also planned to do a mission there, a contact from the Blood Pact Society was in Maple.

Han Xiao looked at the briefing on his laptop.

My contact is a hitman? Wait, this name looks familiar, Golden Fox? Do I know them?

Han Xiao raised his brows. Putting the matter aside, he opened the forum, because his focus were the players.

Han Xiao had two novice villages in the Western Continent left. New players had already reached an average level of ten. By then, many left to explore the map, but because of Han Xiao, some players stayed, waiting.

He felt great. His actions affected many players' actions, all because of the recent popularity boost.

Scrolling the forums, some posts attracted his attention. They were players from Andrea, and they were all complaining.

"Question, why is the Germinal Organization coming to novice villages, and taking us?"

"I've been brainwashed, my faction is locked, and I've lost relationship points. Why?"

"An NPC sliced me to pieces, then asked of my origins."

"Same!"

"Is this part of the storyline? But I didn't get any alerts."

Players recorded Germinal capturing novice players. Armed soldiers placed handcuffs on players. The ones that resisted were shot by paralysis bullets.

Cuffed players were crammed in the back of a truck. They were squeezed together, and the only light they saw was through barred windows.

They were taken to Germinal bases. Their bases, unlike other factions', were hidden. All headquarters in Andrea were massive, with extremely tight defense.

Andrea was brown, and from a satellite, the Germinal bases were black dots, like a spreading virus. This forsaken land was abundant with radiation, and dirt. Germinal stole old ruins, and inherited them, including prior military sites.

The Inhuman Incident had started. Han Xiao's eyes twinkled. He experienced this before, and it was the hottest topic at the time.

NPCs' curiosity towards players was the core of Galaxy, it was part of the storyline. Different planets had different approaches to players, and Aquamarine was the first planet to notice.

Before, Han Xiao was just an onlooker. Now, it was different, and he felt he could figure something out.

Germinal lost all secondary bases, so the number of players joining would be fewer, but they've realized the damage caused.

Imagining their leader's anger made Han Xiao happy.

Han Xiao opened his laptop, and browsed info on the Dark Net. Many organizations had noticed the players, and they were intrigued.

The Six Nations may make a move soon, which would delay the expedition war, but it would still be earlier than my previous life.

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. An earlier war gave him advantages, and disadvantages. Advantages being the players weren't strong enough to make a large impact in the war, which reduced the chaos. As long as the players didn't interfere, Germinal would be unilaterally crushed.

Now, the war would soon enter the climax, without the players' involvement.
