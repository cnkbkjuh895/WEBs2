"What is it?" Yang Dian looked over Ned's shoulder. He was stunned.

Every project related to the Death Virus were regarding body enhancements, and biochemical weapons. There was no mention of a cure.

It was also written the exploration team were gathering materials for body enhancement research.

"I-is this real? He's tricking us, right?"

"He could have killed us then. Why would he trick us?"

Yang Dian, and Ned were enraged.

They were useful idiots from the beginning to the end. They couldn't believe they were so naive to believe their words; like their perserverance was nothing, but a joke.

No wonder he didn't kill them; he probably felt they were pitiful.

Yang Dian was so ashamed he wanted to dig a hole, and hide.

They called themselves superheroes, but they were saved by a stranger who thought of as evil twice! If he hadn't exposed the truth, they would have kept following orders.

"I wish we knew his name. l'd want to apologize to him in person," Ned said.

Yang Dian nodded. Rage burned inside, he called Kate. "You lied to us!"

Kate was shocked. "What did I lie about?"

"You've been using us, making us risk our lives. The exploration team, the cure, it's all fake!"

"Why would I do that? You are overthinking things." Kate paused.

"I have evidence. Your research of the Death Virus has nothing to do with a cure!" Yang Dian said.

"Not true. You guys must've heard some strange rumors."

"Still lying to us, huh?" Yan Dian said the project serial number.

Kate went silent for a while, then he replied. "So what? What can you possibly do?"

"I..." Yang Dian was furious, but he couldn't say anything.

"Humph, 'superhero'!" Kate hung up the call.

Yang Dian froze as he held the phone. His aura changed.

Ned felt a chill. "Are you alright?"

Yang Dian shook his head, and put down the phone. "I'm alright, Why wouldn't I be? Hehe."

...

The institue was in a mess, and the officials were forcing a smile as they negotiated with the military.

Kate was annoyed. He didn't expect this as no one dared mess with them before. There were many banks backing them, and anyone who stroke the tiger's beard faced it's wrath. There'd be no escape.

After contacting their backers, they were all furious. He called himself a Germinal executive officer, and wore an advanced mech, it was too convincing. The Germinal was a mouse crossing the street, everyone wished to beat them, so it wouldn't matter how many enemies they made. It was possible they were throwing the helve after the hatchet.

The banks ordered the Western Continent intelligence to search for him, and funded the mission through military donations to the Six Nations. There were drugs they urgently needed.

Kate didn't bother riling himself up any more by meeting those superheroes, and he didn't mind them finding the truth. Because superheroes weren't so petty to take revenge over this.

...

Han Xiao took of the mech, changed his face, and went into a crowd.

Han Xiao waited a bit, but there were no new rewards. That's it? What do I need a good impression with them for?

They weren't anyone important. Han Xiao was speechless. He would've preferred 100 XP over this!

Never mind, it's just a low-level mission. The real rewards are these drugs.

Han Xiao chuckled as he looked at the backpack in his hands.

He stole... that's wrong, he acqueisced almost every type of drug they had.

He checked into a random hotel, and checked if there were any surveillance cameras. None. He took out the drugs, and arranged them in rows.

Let's see if there's any good stuff. Han Xiao rubbed his hands. He heard one would be lucky if one's hands were heated.

_____________________

Green Lizard Drug (Medium Concentration, 23.3%): Made from Green Lizard Genes. A lazy being. Drinking this will calm you.

_____________________

Han Xiao stunned for three seconds. Then he stood up, and threw it to the floor.

Green, my ass! What's even the point of this drug?! I would've been luckier if I warmed my feet!

Looking at the drugs, Han Xiao felt a black cloud of bad luck was above his head.

Let's hope the others were worthwhile.

He went through them all, and there were a total of 34 types. None were as useless as the Green Lizard drug.

Some were really good.

There was a higher concentration Death Virus Enhancement Drug, the permanent attribute boost was great, and the chance to awaken the rare talent was 3x higher.

_____________________

Wild Rhinoceros Steroid: Made from the heart of a wild rhinoceros. Injection gives +5 STR, +5 END, and lasts five minutes. Cooldown of 30 minutes for second injection.

_____________________

Thunder Claw Beast Extraction: Extracted fluids of a Thunder Claw Beast. +12% melee attack for the next five attacks.

_____________________

Stone Plaque Pathogen: Infects the user with Stone Plaque.

_____________________

There were three types: temporary enhancement, disease spreading, and permanent enhancment.

Some of the permanent enhancment drugs were one-use, some limited-use. Eagle Predator Drug, the former, Death Virus Drug, the latter.

That's why players were passionate about the Forbidden Zone, and the BOSS. Usually, it was a competition between large guilds.

_____________________

You used the Eagle Predator Drug.

+3 DEX.

Han Xiao took a short break, and finished all four Death Virus Drugs in one shot. His Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance increased by four, and the bottle with highest concentration awakened the rare talent.
